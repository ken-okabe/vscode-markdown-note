## VSCode + Markdown + WYSIWYG = Productivity

---

# üî∑ Seamless

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo00.gif)

 **Click**  on what you want to edit to enter input mode.

Once you finish editing, press the   `ESC`  key.

Press the   `ESC`   key again to return to input mode.

---

# üî∑ Cell Editing

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo01.gif)

**Cell**  is familiar to Jupyter Notebook users.

Every  **Cell**  has its  **own isolated editing history** , so  **undo&redo**  works uniquely.

---

# üî∑ Headers

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo02.gif)

You can see the exact header size based on the current CSS  **before converting to HTML**  by entering  `#` .

---

# üî∑ Paste URL & ImageURL from Clipboard

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo_image.gif)

You can use a shortcut key (`Ctrl+L` for URLs, `Ctrl+P` for images by default Key Bindings) to paste  **URLs**  or  **imageURLs**  from the clipboard as Markdown  on *selected text* .

Here is how it goes:

0. Your clipboard has an imageURL:  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/octcat.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/octcat.png)

1. Type any image name in the Cell (**octcat**) 
2. Select all, then paste the **imageURL** (`Ctrl+A,P`)
3. Exit the Cell (`Esc`)

 **Alternatively, you can skip typing the image name and just** 

1. Paste the **imageURL** (`Ctrl+P`)
2. Exit the Cell (`Esc`)

 **and it will work just fine üòé** 

For **imageURLs**, `image` is used as the default name.

For **URLs**, the pasted URL itself is used as the default link text. So when you just paste `https://github.com/` with `Ctrl+L`, the result will be [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

---

# üî∑ Drag&Drop Cells

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo04.gif)

---

# üî∑ GFM & features supported by GitHub

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo05.gif)

---

# üî∑ Paste Code & Mathematics(LaTeX) from Clipboard

In **Markdown Note**, you can add **Code & Mathematics(LaTeX)** in the same way as  **Paste URL & ImageURL from Clipboard**.

- We usually copy&paste  **URLs**  &  **ImageURLs**  from the clipboard.
- We usually copy&paste  **Code**  &  **Mathematics(LaTeX)**  from the clipboard.

---

 $Mathematics(LaTeX)$ 

0. Your clipboard has:
`\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.`

1. Paste the **Math** (`Ctrl+M`)
2. Exit the Cell (`Esc`)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo_mathjax.gif)

---

 $Code (including Mermaid)$ 

0. Your clipboard has:

```
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```

1. Paste the **Code** (`Ctrl+K`)
2. Exit the Cell (`Esc`)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo_mermaid.gif)

---

 $Inline$ 

To insert **inlineCode** & **inlineMath**, you can use the same operation as for (inline) **Bold** or (inline) **Italic**, that is, select the  *target strings* , then press the **ShortcutKey**: `Ctrl+?`.

---

# üî∑ ReadOnly & Writable Mode

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo_readonly.gif)

By default,  **Markdown Note**  works in  **Writable Mode** , but some web elements need user's click action even in Markdown documents.

For example,  **Markdown used in GitHub**  ( *not GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec* ) supports `<details>` and `<summary>` html tags.

To test the native behavior, you can switch to  **ReadOnly Mode**  temporarily with `Ctrl+Esc`.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo_detail.gif)

In  **ReadOnly Mode** , the default behavior of  **Markdown Note**  is paused and you can click the element in the standard manner.

This way, you can see how `<details>` and `<summary>` html tags work.

 Pressing `Ctrl+Esc` again  will return to the default  **Writable Mode**.

---

# üî∑ Side-by-side mode is also WYSIWYG

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo06.gif)

---

# üî∑ Unidirectional Data Flow

Bidirectional data flow might look cool, but it often causes confusion for both humans and software architectures.

 **The conventional Markdown Preview**  has a unidirectional data flow :

- Markdown source code -> The read-only preview.

 **Markdown Note**  also uses the same simple unidirectional design, but *in the opposite direction* :

- WYSIWYG Editor -> Markdown source code.

---

# üî∑ Reload to Side or Overlay

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo08.gif)

The user needs to **reload the contents explicitly after editing the Markdown source code in the standard VSCode editor, since the data flow is unidirectional** .

The user can choose which panel to reload:

-  **to Side** 
-  **Overlay** 

The reload action helps to **reconstruct the entire markdown Cells with integrity** after a full modification of the document by native editing.

---

# üî∑ Key Bindings (Extension Keyboard Shortcuts)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/keybindings.png)

You can use Key Bindings for everything except drag and drop; you can also customize them.

---

# üî∑ Paste Images with one Keystroke

The general key binding `Ctrl+V` for **pasting** works for **both text and images** .

With one Keystroke, this feature allows you to **upload the clipboard image** to *your own image-only repository on GitHub* and automatically insert its URL in the Cell to display it.

You need to create *a dedicated image repository* and *an access token on GitHub* to use this feature. **This feature does not work with secret repositories, and your images will be public.**

You can also use *a secret Gist* to store your images, but there is no API for that yet.

You can still display images by using your own URL as before, if you prefer not to use a public repository or a secret Gist.

---

# üî∑ Works with VSCode‚Äôs full potential

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/demo07.gif)

You can use VSCode features, such as **undo/redo/select the whole document** , or **managing files with directories and Git** , for any operations that are not suitable for the Cell editing.

# üî∑ Getting Started

## Take advantage of VSCode  `Empty Profile` 

 **To get started quickly and simply, you can take advantage of an empty and isolated VSCode profile to install Markdown Note, or use any VSCode profile you like later.** 

---

## 0. Create a new VSCode  `Empty Profile`, then install Markdown Note

### Click ‚öôÔ∏è at the left bottom to Create Profile

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/0profile.png)

### Select  `Empty Profile` 

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/1emptyprofile.png)

### Let's name the new profile  `writing`

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/2writing.png)

### Now you have the new `Empty Profile`

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/3profilecreated.png)

### Finally, please remember to install  Markdown Note in the new `Empty Profile` !!üòé

---

## 1. Copy&Paste the `JSON`  *copied at the built-in walkthrough page*  into the empty  `settings.json`  of `Empty Profile`

### After installing Markdown Note, the built-in Setup Walkthrough page will automatically launch.

### Use `Ctrl+A` to select all, then `Ctrl+C` to copy the automatically generated JSON on the page.

### 

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/walkthrough.png)

### Paste (`Ctrl+A,P`) into the empty  `settings.json`  of `Empty Profile` 

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/7blankobject.png)

### Save ( `Ctrl+S` ) and Done!

 **The built-in Setup Walkthrough page guides you step by step and does not require VSCode reload, so for now just prepare  `Empty Profile`.** 

---

## Command for VSCode Profiles

 **You can use the `--profile` command-line interface option to launch VS Code with a specific profile.** 

```sh
code --profile writing my-documents
```

 **A new `Empty Profile` with the given name is created if the profile specified does not exist.** 

---

# üî∑ Settings & Customizations

## `settings.json` Simplified

Here is a simplified `settings.json`  .

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/settings-json.png)

---

### System

```json
"files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
"files.autoSaveDelay": 500,
```

If  `autoSave`  with a short interval is not enabled, the VSCode standard editor will report an error on saving that is similar to the  **Git non-fast-forward error**. This issue has not been thoroughly investigated, but  `500` ms seems to be a reliable and stable setting.

---

```json
"workbench.editor.autoLockGroups": {
   "mainThreadWebview-MarkdownNote": true
},
```

This is `autoLockGroups` feature, which is neccesary for  **Side-by-side mode**.  `LockGroup`  allows you to lock an editor group in VSCode to prevent unintended multi-tab experiences. Without this feature, a user would need to manually lock the group on every occasion.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/lockgroup.png)

---

### Themes

```json
"workbench.colorTheme": "Visual Studio Light",
```

In most cases, the theme in VSCode is configured through a GUI.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/theme-gui.png)

 **Some dark themes can make the scroll bar almost invisible in Markdown note.** 

---

```json
"markdownnote.CSS": {
    "URLs": [
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/github-markdown-css/5.2.0/github-markdown.min.css",
    "https://unpkg.com/prism-themes@1.9.0/themes/prism-coldark-dark.min.css"
    ]
},
```

[There are CSSs to replicate the GitHub Markdown style](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css):

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/setup/dark.png)

[You can generate by yourself.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/generate-github-markdown-css)

```sh
$ github-markdown-css --list
light
dark
dark_dimmed
dark_high_contrast
dark_colorblind
light_colorblind
light_high_contrast
light_tritanopia
dark_tritanopia
```

 **Code highlighting can be styled independently with [Prism](https://prismjs.com/)** 

---

### Utility Options

```json
"markdownnote.start_overlay": {
    "true OR false": true
},
```

You can select a layout ( **Overlay** or **Side-by-side** ) to start with;  **Overlay**  is the default.

---

```json
"markdownnote.image_repository": {
    "repository": "USER/IMAGES-REPOSITORY",
    "token": "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

The general key binding `Ctrl+V` for **pasting** works for **both text and images** .

With one Keystroke, this feature allows you to **upload the clipboard image** to *your own image-only repository on GitHub* and automatically insert its URL in the Cell to display it.

You need to create *a dedicated image repository* and *an access token on GitHub* to use this feature. **This feature does not work with secret repositories, and your images will be public.**

For more information on managing personal access tokens on GitHub, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

# üî∑ The ultimate note & memo App built on VSCode

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/todo.png)

VSCode is such a great editor. 

The only problem with VSCode is that it‚Äôs not suitable for  **casual use as a daily note and memo app** . 

The reason is that Markdown editing is  **not WYSIWYG** .

 **Markdown Note transforms VSCode into your daily note and memo app, and it's probably the most powerful one in the world.** 

Your notes and memos are now natively managed with  **secret repos in GitHub** !

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/vscode-markdown-note/main/_images/note-shortcut.png)

With combinations of VSCode profile and command, you can easily create a shortcut key to launch the app.

This is Linux & Gnome, and the way to create shortcut keys and icons differs depending on the OS.

In this case,

- Profile is `note`
- Directory is `/home/ken/Documents/note`
- Shorcut key is `Ctrl+F1`

```sh
code --profile note /home/ken/Documents/note
```
